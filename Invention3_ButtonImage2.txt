Blocks is where the coding begins!

You can click block on the top right

In this code, we want to make the image visible when we press the button

In here, we will need to use blocks from Button1 & Image1

So the tip: Do not always focus on one element/variable or component when trying to merge two of them together (example of this is image and button)

============

Built-in are the coding functions rather than variable or component function, so also focus on that (in this case "true" is logic)

Just make non-visible default just by the properties, do not rush yourself!
