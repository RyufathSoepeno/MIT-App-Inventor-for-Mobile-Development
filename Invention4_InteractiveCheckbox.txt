In this tutorial we will show you how to create a working and interactive checkbox app, that allows user to click and display what they clicked (by TheCodingBus)

We use another label (label3) to display the results

"Join" in text variable combines two texts at once functionality, it appends all of the inputs to make a single string 

If we don't use join, it will only display one result, despite we have checked more than one box



ANY ELEMENT WITH A GEAR CAN BE USED TO EDIT THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE VARIABLE



Join can also be used for formatting

Algorithm is like this: Show label -> give comma format -> show another value of label and checkbox (if applied)
